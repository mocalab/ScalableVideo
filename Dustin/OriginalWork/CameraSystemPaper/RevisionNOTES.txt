--FUNDAMENTAL DISCOVERY: To scale a video when the bandwidth changes, an SVM can be used to model the user's quality preferences.

--Extensive literature on the application of machine learning to object detection
--Look at "Providing QoS through machine-learning-driven adaptive multimedia applications"

--FOCUS ON THE USE OF THE SVM, NOT THE HEURISTIC (or, make note of the heuristic os number of training data in the limitations part) 
--"The value of 17.28 was determined empirically by observing the behavior of the system when changing the temporal resolution of the video." (limitations section)
