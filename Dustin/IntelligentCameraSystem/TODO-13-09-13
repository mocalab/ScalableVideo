-Video not playing although it is being streamed... use the fact that it tells us it is not playing to loop until it plays
-Board has trouble keeping up with client connects/disconnects
-Connection time... freezing the UI thread when it has trouble finding the host
-Says we're playing... but black screen??? Must solve this...
